     simple demo of HTML forms via Flask
     
     trioTASK:
     If any member of team has forms experience, let their know-how OSMOTE.
     If no one does, seek external assistance.
     
     PROTIP: Revisit code from intro if you have it.
     Peruse this code together and discuss how it should work,
       in conjunction with the back end apparatus.

    <h1>
      HEYOOOOOOO WELCOME TO POPEYES WHERE YOU CAN GET $4.89 POPEYES SANDWICHES
    </h1>


    <h3>
      <br> Your inputted username: {{user}} </br>
      <br> Request Method: {{meth}} </br>
    </h3>
      <br> The request method defaults to GET unless the form specifies to use a POST method. 
            GET and POST are mutually exclusive.
            GET corresponds with request.args so when a GET request is made, the form input is stored in request.args. 
            POST corresponds with request.form so when a POST request is made the form input is stored in request.form. 
            Regardless, we are able to see if a GET request is made if we see the form input in the url after submitting the form. 
            We can also check the terminal which tells us if a GET or POST request is made.
            In the following app.py code, we check if request.args or request.forms contain an input to distinguish between GET and POST requests.
