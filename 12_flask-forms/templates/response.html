     simple demo of HTML forms via Flask
     
     trioTASK:
     If any member of team has forms experience, let their know-how OSMOTE.
     If no one does, seek external assistance.
     
     PROTIP: Revisit code from intro if you have it.
     Peruse this code together and discuss how it should work,
       in conjunction with the back end apparatus.

      HEYOOOOOOO WELCOME TO POPEYES WHERE YOU CAN GET $4.89 POPEYES SANDWICHES
    </h1>


    <h3>
      <br> Your inputted username: {{user}} </br>
      <br> Request Method: {{meth}} </br>
    </h3>
      <br> The request method defaults to GET unless the form specifies to use a POST method. 
            GET and POST are mutually exclusive.
            GET corresponds with request.args so when a GET request is made, the form input is stored in request.args. 
            POST corresponds with request.form so when a POST request is made the form input is stored in request.form. 
            Regardless, we are able to see if a GET request is made if we see the form input in the url after submitting the form. 
            We can also check the terminal which tells us if a GET or POST request is made.
            In the following app.py code, we check if request.args or request.forms contain an input to distinguish between GET and POST requests.
