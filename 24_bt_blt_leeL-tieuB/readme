DISCO:
- can link buttons/links to a part of your page by doing href="index.html#<id of what you want to link to>"

QCC:
- is the grid the only way to use flex alignment?

q0: 1

q0b:
- Bootstrap Grid Documentation (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/)

q1: Foundation!
- We prefer Foundation because we thought it was easier to implement into our site and that the documentation was cleaner than Bootstrap's.
