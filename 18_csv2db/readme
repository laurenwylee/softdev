DictReader takes in a database/file, reads each column as a list of values associated with a key into a dictionary. 
If you don't provide a fieldname parameters into DictReader, the first row of the database will become the keys.

When you don't want to hard-code values into a SQL command, you can use an fstring or concatenate strings and variables together

fetchall() and fetchone() return elements from a table
