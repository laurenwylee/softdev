v0:
* app =  Flask(__name__) --> similar to java syntx
* @app.route("/") --> decorator tells  you where the function will return, assign fxn to route
* hello_world() is right under the decorator and bound to the decorator, will be called without a call
* print statements in terminal
* return prints of webpage

v2: 
* multiple strings can be printed in the terminal

v3:
* Error message when running in Firefox when running in thonny
    * Firefox canâ€™t establish a connection to the server at 127.0.0.1:5000
    * Message in thonny: /usr/bin/python3: No module named thonny.plugins.cpython.app
    * thonny stops running program
    * website works when running in terminal
* app.debug = True refreshes the webapge everytime something in the source code if changed


V4:
* if __name__ == "_main__" is true if this file is NOT imported
    what does this mean?

Our app.py:
import csv --> using csv module to read csv file
    * we want to read the csv one time
    * to do this, write it after the function under the decorator
    * the script is run one time at the python3 app.py command
* function right under the decorator is called without explicit calling. All functions under need to be called
