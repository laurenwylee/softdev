    <h3> History </h3>
    <p>
        The Google Page Rank Algorithm revolutionized the search engine industry.
    </p>
    <h4>Early Text Based Algorithms</h4>
    <p>
        In the early 90’s, the first search engines used a text based ranking system which would return pages with the highest number of occurrences of a certain keyword that was inputted. However this not only led to the return of many low-quality matches (for example pages with just the keyword being repeated over and over again) but also allowed advertisers to exploit the algorithm by populating web pages with “invisible keywords” which are text that can’t be seen by regular visitors to the page but can be seen by search engines. 
    </p>
    <h4>here Comes the Page Rank Algorithm</h4>
    <p>
        So comes Larry Page and Sergey Brin who decide to create an algorithm called PageRank that would objectively measure the relative importance of web pages by computing a ranking for every web page.   Google decides to determine the importance of a web page by using the network structure of the Web by taking into account two things: the number of web pages that links to the certain web page and the PageRank score or the importance of the web pages themselves that refer to the certain web page. We can understand how this works by looking at the Google Page Rank Algorithm.

    <h3> The Algorithm </h3>
    <h4>Random Surfer Model</h4>
    <p>
        The Randome Surfer model is based on the idea of a random surfer on the web who when randomly given a webpage continually randomly clicks on links in that web page to get to new pages. If we let a random surfer keep doing that and increase the score of each webpage the surfer visits, eventually the page rank scores will stabilize. Probability wise, a page that has more pages linking to that page will have a high page rank and a page has a highly authoritative page linking to that page will have a high page rank
