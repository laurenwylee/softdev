PageRank
James Yu's Group:
    - defined backlink & forward link
        - backlink is link pointing towards the Page
        - forwardlink is link that is pointing out of the Page
    - defined each element of the equation
    - explainations were very articulate but some variables like c were unclear
    - dangling links -- webapage without forward links --  pagerank removes pages w dangling links
    - rank sink was very confusing -- still have trouble understanding the solution

Talia + Jasmine:
    - history lesson!!
    - I'd like to learn more about the big o runtime
    - avoiding the equation was actually more effective for explaining page rank
    - highlighting made important points easy to locate


DOM:
- A DOM is the Document Object Model
    - programming interface for web documents
        - allows you to change the document structure, style and content
        - rep document as nodes and objects so programming languages can interact w the page
    - DOM is an API for manipulating DOM trees of HTML and XML documents -- API allows you to modify DOM tree
- virtual DOM is like real DOM but more lightweight
- in react, it updates the virtual DOM, compares to real DOM and only updates part of DOM needed
