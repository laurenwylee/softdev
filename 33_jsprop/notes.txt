DISCO:
* The third parameter of the addEventListener() determines whether the events occur in a bubbling or a capturing order.
    * Bubbling Order: Starting from the inner tage and going to the outer tags.
    * Capturing Order: Starting from the outer tags and going to the inner tags.
* stopPropagation() runs a function once, and then stops the funtion from running again, even if it is called multiple times.
* The <tr> and <td> alerts need for loops since there are multiple <tr> and <td> tags in the HTML file.
  However, the <table> alert does not need a for loop since there is only one <table> tag.

QCC:
* The optional third parameter of addEventListener() has many options in which all are booleans. How does JS know which option the parameter is?
