K19 -- Sessions Greetings
2022-11-03
time spent: 3

DISCO:
* Code within try blocks should be short and the except block should anticipate a specific error
* redirect() instead of render_template() will redirect the user to a certain url
* Start a session by generating a secret key and assigning a value to session['username']
* End a session by doing session.pop() on the username

QCC:
* We weren't sure how to use exception handling to anticipate errors. What errors were we supposed to anticipate and how would we use try and except guarantee no fails?
* Is it possible to use GET requests with sessions?
* Do we only need to create a session for 'username' and not 'pass'?
