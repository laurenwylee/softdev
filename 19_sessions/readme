K11 -- Form(s) Like Voltron
2022-10-14
time spent: 0.5

Predictions/Notable
* request is a new thing we are importing
* <form> tags in login.html
* homepage of app.py will be a login screen

DISCO
* ImmutableMultiDict([]) is what stores the input.
* Value after submission: ImmutableMultiDict([('username', 'drowning'), ('sub1', 'Submit Query')])
* request.headers displays info abt machine doing the request
* <form action="/auth"> links front and back end
* uncommenting lines 40-41 leads to an error message on the home webpage:

  werkzeug.exceptions.BadRequestKeyError: 400 Bad Request: The browser (or proxy) sent a request that this server could not understand.
  KeyError: 'username'

  we suspect this is happening because on the login page, no text has been submitted yet, so there is no value for the name "username"
* uncommenting lines 56-57 doesn't cause an error, the inputted username is displayed in terminal
* GET is easier to debug bc when importing form response, the result is in the URL
* POST is harder to debug
* URL with GET (not commented out): http://127.0.0.1:5000/auth?username=drowning&sub1=Submit+Query
* URL without GET (commented out): http://127.0.0.1:5000/auth?username=drowning&sub1=Submit+Query
* ^ URLs are the same

Hypothesis
* Flask/Python automatically uses GET bc even with GET and POST methods commented out, this displays in terminal when the home page is refreshed:

  <insert message here>
